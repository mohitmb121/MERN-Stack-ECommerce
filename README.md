# E-Commerce MERN Stack Project

Welcome to my E-Commerce MERN stack project! This project showcases the implementation of a full-stack eCommerce application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

## Getting Started

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Navigate into the project directory:
cd your-repo

3. Install server dependencies:
npm install


4. Navigate to the client directory:
